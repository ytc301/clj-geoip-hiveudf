# clj-geoip-hiveudf

`clj-geoip-hiveudf` is a Hadoop Hive UDF wrapper around [`clj-geoip`](https://github.com/bertschneider/clj-geoip),
itself "a thin [Clojure](http://www.clojure.com) layer on top
of the legacy [MaxMind GeoIP Java API](https://github.com/maxmind/geoip-api-java)."

## Usage

```
hive> add jar clj-geoip-hiveudf-<version>;
hive> create temporary function geoip as 'clj-geoip-hiveudf.hive.udf.Simple';
```

## Testing

This project uses the [Speclj BDD testing framework](http://speclj.com/).

Write your tests first in `spec/clj-geoip-hiveudf/core_spec.clj`, run them expecting them to
fail, then implement your test-passing functions in `src/clj-geoip-hiveudf/core.clj`. Always
do this, running your tests on a regular rhythm along with your production code:

```bash
â†’ lein spec --reporter=d
Compiling clj-geoip-hiveudf.core
Compiling clj-geoip-hiveudf.hive.udf.Simple

Salutation
- should be warmly welcoming to Bob Dobbs

Valediction
- should be wistfully leave-taking of Bob Dobbs

## Future / Enhancements

What's up next:

1. Re-implement UDF as a GenericUDF

Pull requests will be very happily considered.
